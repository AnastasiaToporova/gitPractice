            <p>
                This is a file, which you could create in the root of your repository. All files, which are match patterns from gitignore,
would be untracked by default. This could be binary files; files, which are generated by IDE, logs, ect. So all of this files exist
in you project directory, but you will never want to commit them to repository.
The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="list_gitinore">
                <ol> Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.</ol>
                <ol>Standard glob patterns work.</ol>
                <ol>You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity. </ol>
                <ol>You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.</ol>
                <ol>You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).</ol>
            </ul>
        </div>
